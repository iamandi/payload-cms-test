Payload Collections are defined through configs of their own, and you can define as many as your application needs. Each Collection will scaffold a MongoDB collection automatically based on fields that you define.

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main Payload config.

## Options

| Option           | Description  |
| ---------------- | -------------|
| **`slug`** *     | Unique, URL-friendly string that will act as an identifier for this Collection. |
| **`fields`** *   | Array of field types that will determine the structure and functionality of the data stored within this Collection. [Click here](/docs/fields/overview) for a full list of field types as well as how to configure them. |
| **`labels`**     | Singular and plural labels for use in identifying this Collection throughout Payload. |
| **`admin`**      | Admin-specific configuration. See below for [more detail](/docs/collections#admin). |
| **`hooks`**      | Entry points to "tie in" to Collection actions at specific points. [More](/docs/hooks/overview#collection-hooks) |
| **`access`**     | Provide access control functions to define exactly who should be able to do what with Documents in this Collection. [More](/docs/access-control/overview/#collections) |
| **`auth`**       | Specify options if you would like this Collection to feature authentication. For more, consult the [Authentication](/docs/authentication/config) documentation. |
| **`upload`**     | Specify options if you would like this Collection to support file uploads. For more, consult the [Uploads](/docs/uploads/overview) documentation. |
| **`timestamps`** | Set to false to disable documents' automatically generated `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps. |

#### Simple collection example

```js
const Order = {
	slug: 'orders',
	labels: {
		singular: 'Order',
		plural: 'Orders',
	},
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'total',
			type: 'number',
			required: true,
		},
		{
			name: 'placedBy',
			type: 'relationship',
			relationTo: 'customers',
			required: true,
		}
	]
}
```

#### More collection config examples

You can find an assortment of [example collection configs](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/demo/collections) in the Payload source code on GitHub.

### Admin options

You can customize the way that the Admin panel behaves on a collection-by-collection basis by defining the `admin` property on a collection's config.

| Option                       | Description  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------|
| `useAsTitle`                 | Specify a top-level field to use for a document title throughout the Admin panel. If no field is defined, the ID of the document is used as the title. |
| `defaultColumns`             | Array of field names that correspond to which columns to show by default in this collection's List view. |
| `disableDuplicate `          | Disables the "Duplicate" button while editing documents within this collection. |
| `enableRichTextRelationship` | The [Rich Text](/docs/fields/rich-text) field features a `Relationship` element which allows for users to automatically reference related documents within their rich text. Set this field to `true` to enable the collection to be selected within it. |
| `preview`        | Function to generate preview URLS within the Admin panel that can point to your app. [More](/docs/collections#preview). |
| `components`                 | Swap in your own React components to be used within this collection. [More](/docs/admin/components#collections) |

### Preview

Collection `admin` options can accept a `preview` function that will be used to generate a link pointing to the frontend of your app to preview data.

If the function is specified, a Preview button will automatically appear in the corresponding collection's Edit view. Clicking the Preview button will link to the URL that is generated by the function.

The preview function accepts the document being edited as an argument.

**Example collection with preview function:**

```js
{
	slug: 'posts',
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'slug',
			type: 'text',
			required: true,
		}
	]
	admin: {
		preview: (doc) => {
			if (doc?.slug) {
				return `https://bigbird.com/preview/posts/${doc.slug}`,
			}

			return null;
		}
	}
}
```

### Access control

You can specify extremely granular access control (what users can do with documents in a collection) on a collection by collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](/docs/access-control/overview) docs.

### Hooks

Hooks are a powerful way to extend collection functionality and execute your own logic, and can be defined on a collection by collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](/docs/hooks/overview) documentation.

### Field types

Collections support all field types that Payload has to offerâ€”including simple fields like text and checkboxes all the way to more complicated layout-building field groups like Blocks. [Click here](/docs/fields/config) to learn more about field types.
