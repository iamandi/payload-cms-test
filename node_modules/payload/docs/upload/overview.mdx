  Payload provides for everything you need to enable file upload, storage, and management directly on your serverâ€”including extremely powerful file access control.

**Here are some common use cases of Uploads:**

- Creating a "Media Library" that contains images for use throughout your site or app
- Building a Gated Content library where users need to sign up to gain access to downloadable assets like ebook PDFs, whitepapers, etc.
- Storing publicly available, downloadable assets like software, ZIP files, MP4s, etc.

**By simply enabling Upload functionality on a Collection, Payload will automatically transform your Collection into a robust file management / storage solution. The following modifications will be made:**

1. `filename`, `mimeType`, and `filesize` fields will be automatically added to your Collection. Optionally, if you pass `imageSizes` to your Collection's Upload config, a [`sizes`](#image-sizes) array will also be added containing auto-resized image sizes and filenames.
1.  The Admin panel will modify its built-in `List` component to show a thumbnail gallery of your Uploads instead of the default Table view
1. The Admin panel will modify its `Edit` view(s) to add a new set of corresponding Upload UI which will allow for file upload
1. The `create`, `update`, and `delete` Collection operations will be modified to support file upload, re-upload, and deletion

### Enabling Uploads

Every Payload Collection can opt-in to supporting Uploads by specifying the `upload` property on the Collection's config to either `true` or to an object containing `upload` options.

  A common pattern is to create a <strong>Media</strong> collection and enable <strong>upload</strong> on that collection.

#### Collection Upload Options

| Option                 | Description  |
| ---------------------- | -------------|
| **`staticURL`** *      | The base URL path to use to access you uploads. Example: `/media` |
| **`staticDir`** *      | The folder directory to use to store media in. Can be either an absolute path or relative to the directory that contains your config. |
| **`imageSizes`**       | If specified, image uploads will be automatically resized in accordance to these image sizes. [More](#image-sizes) |
| **`adminThumbnail`**   | Which of your provided image sizes to use for the admin panel's thumbnail. Typically a size around 500x500px or so works well. |

*An asterisk denotes that a property above is required.*

**Example Upload collection:**
```js
const Media = {
  slug: 'media',
  upload: {
    staticURL: '/media',
    staticDir: 'media',
    imageSizes: [
      {
        name: 'thumbnail',
        width: 400,
        height: 300,
        crop: 'centre',
      },
      {
        name: 'card',
        width: 768,
        height: 1024,
        crop: 'centre',
      }
    ],
    adminThumbnail: 'thumbnail',
  }
}
```

### Payload-wide Upload Options

Payload relies on the [`express-fileupload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-fileupload) package to manage file uploads in Express. In addition to the Upload options specifiable on a Collection by Collection basis, you can also control the `express-fileupload` options by passing your base Payload config an `upload` property containing an object supportive of all `express-fileupload` properties which use `Busboy` under the hood. [Click here](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy#api) for more documentation about what you can control.

A common example of what you might want to customize within Payload-wide Upload options would be to increase the allowed `fileSize` of uploads sent to Payload:

```js
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';

export default buildConfig({
  serverURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  collections: [
    {
      slug: 'media',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'alt',
          type: 'text',
        },
      ],
      upload: true,
    },
  ],
  upload: {
    limits: {
      fileSize: 5000000, // 5MB, written in bytes
    }
  }
});
```

### Image Sizes

If you specify an array of `imageSizes` to your `upload` config, Payload will automatically crop and resize your uploads to fit each of the sizes specified by your config.

The Payload Admin panel will also automatically display all available files, including width, height, and filesize, for each of your uploaded files.

Behind the scenes, Payload relies on [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize#resize) to perform its image resizing. You can specify additional options for `sharp` to use while resizing your images.

### Uploading Files

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Important:</strong><br/>
  Uploading files is currently only possible through the REST API due to how GraphQL works. It's difficult and fairly nonsensical to support uploading files through GraphQL.
</Banner>

To upload a file, use your collection's [`create`](/docs/rest-api/overview#collections) endpoint. Send it all the data that your Collection requires, as well as a `file` key containing the file that you'd like to upload.

Send your request as a `multipart/form-data` request, using [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) if possible.

[Here is a walkthrough](https://muffinman.io/blog/uploading-files-using-fetch-multipart-form-data/) detailing how to upload files as `multipart/form-data` using React.

### Access Control

All files that are uploaded to each Collection automatically support the `read` [Access Control](/docs/access-control/overview) function from the Collection itself. You can use this to control who should be allowed to see your uploads, and who should not.
